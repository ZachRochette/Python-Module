# Overview

The point of this project is to practice the Python language.
To further my skills with Python I will be creating a tic-tac-toe game where you will play against an AI.
My purpose for writing this software is so that I can further my knowledge with the Python coding language. I will need to push myself in order to complete this assignment, and hopefully will have created something fun to use by the end of it.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
